# Peter Rasmussen, Lab 3

This ```README``` serves as an informational entry point into the Python module lab3.

## Lab Structure

* ```lab3/```: Python module that adds, subtracts, and multiplies polynomial expressions.
    * **Please note this module includes its own ```README```** which explains how to run the Python
      module, features of the module, inputs and outputs, example output file, and licensing.
* ```analysis/```: PDF of an analysis of various aspects of the Python module.
* ```resources/```: Required and additional datasets; each input has its correspondingly-named output.

## Note

* In an email, Dr. Chlan indicated I could use Python dictionaries to organize polynomial node data.
* For reference, a PDF of this email is provided in the ```resources``` directory.
